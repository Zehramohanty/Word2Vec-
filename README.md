# Word2Vec-
The goal of the skip-gram word2vec algorithm is to accurately learn the probability distribution P(O|C). Given a specific word o and a specific word c, we want to calculate P(O = o|C = c), which is the probability that word o is an ‘outside’ word for c, i.e., the probability that o falls within the contextual window of c.
